Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
I chose a bat because I have some inside jokes about bats with my friends. It was fun to add the additional method "shapeshift" and "bite" to the Bat class to give it some fun things to do.
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
I added "shapeshift" and "bite" to transfer vampire qualities and rabies to other bats. I initially I also created a human class so that a bat could bite a human, but unfortunately I was a bit short on time so I did not get to fully flesh it out.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I think I started pretty early but I still think I could've spent more time on it. It would be helfpul in the future to have an in-class tutorial on how to use something like a time function so that I could do more with the rest() function, but I might've been able to do that if I had spent more time on it as well.
